TODO items
-----------

* To Merge VSEncodingNaive with VSEncodingBlocks

These codes are very similiar, so these should be merged while keeping
their current performances.

* Vectorize the series of VSEncodingXXX

Vectorization with SSE2 and AVX2 could improves their performance.

* Memory Management and Exception Safety

To make codes about managing memory simple and efficient. There are
some stupid codes about memory allocation in VSEncoding or something.

* Newest Encoder/Decoder Implimentation

A newest coder was proposed in CIKM'11, which is titled 'SIMD-based
Decoding of Posting Lists'. We would like the coder to be appended
into this library.

* FIXME Items to be Modified

There are many FIXME items in the sources of this library. These items
should be modified in the future.
